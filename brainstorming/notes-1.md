## Reflection

Originally, I was keep on te idea of a runescape + minecraft theme, but I am realizing there could be some big problems with that.

- One of the major upsides was supposed to be scalability and automation, which makes me think IC2/buildcraft, which I just dont see fitting in
- How would leveling, servers, worlds, pvp, and an economy (?) all manage to fit together
- With something like automation, it seems to all be about collecting resources (and it insane quantities compared to by hand), which just doesnt seem to make sense

## A new path

- More of a diablo + leage vibe
- Different character classes, with a complex ability tree
- Possibly a way to incorprate leveling

## Ideas

- Ability tree inspired by the world of tanks / war thunder upgrade system
- Possibly decisive/in-decisive splits
    - Aka : you have to pick 1, or you can have both
    - Maybe something like: pick 3/5 options (?)
    - Pick 3/5, then choose 1/2 for each of those, and then you can upgrade that 1 further
- Should you be locked in once you pick, or should you be able to switch at a later time?
    - Maybe you can switch, but only at some home base location
- Abilities/upgrades cost a certain number of category points
    - Ex: you can only have so much offense/defense/mobility
    - These tolerances increase as you level up
    - I like how fate had that 2 separate level system: +5/+2 on the left/right
- Character classes
    - Melee/Magic/Ranged
- 4 ability slots
- Ability tree
    - You have to unlock abilities (with some sort of points, xp, or currency (?))
        - Within an ability, you can select 3/5 (?) upgrades (once unlocked, as well)
        - With each of those upgrades, you can take 1/2 further upgrade paths
        - You can then upgrade that path 1 more time
    - 3 (?) tiers of abilities
        - Tier `x` with full 3/5 ≈ Tier `x + 1`
        - Tier `x` with full upgrades ≈ Tier `x + 2`
- Gameplay
    - Can not decide between a world similar to fate/diablo/rs/league
    - I think it might be possible to incorporate multiple elements
        - Ex: You can play more of a free roaming world, or do a moba pvp game-mode, with the same/similar abilities
